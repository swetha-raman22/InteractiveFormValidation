INTERACTIVE FORM VALIDATION
An interactive form validation web application built using ReactJS / Angular, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides real-time validation, instant feedback, and secure data handling to ensure accurate user input before form submission.
It focuses on enhancing user experience, form usability, and data integrity through responsive design and accessibility support.
PROJECT OVERVIEW
The goal of this project is to design and develop a dynamic validation system that:
- Checks form inputs in real-time as users type.
- Displays clear error/success messages for instant correction.
- Prevents submission of incomplete or invalid data.
- Ensures security, performance, and cross-browser compatibility.
This system is designed for registration, login, and feedback forms commonly used in web applications.
OBJECTIVE
To create a responsive, user-friendly, and secure validation system that:
- Improves data accuracy and user satisfaction.
- Reduces form submission errors.
- Integrates both client-side and server-side validation.
- Enhances accessibility for all users, including those using assistive technologies.
